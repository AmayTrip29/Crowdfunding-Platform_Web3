## Getting Started

To set up the project, run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

Edit `src/main.jsx` to start modifying the page. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In `src/index.jsx`, the `ThirdwebProvider` wraps the app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
